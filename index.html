                    <h3>Food for a family</h3>
                    <p>Safe food and water supplies are a major concern following a natural disaster. Our first step is
                        giving food. Knowing how to safely handle food and water in the immediate few days after the
                        disaster can reduce stress, worry and inconvenience.</p>

                    <h3>Shelter for a family</h3>
                    <p>Finding shelter is critical in times of disaster. Shelter outside of the hazard area could
                        include staying with family or friends, seeking a hotel room, or staying in a mass shelter. We
                        are donating shelter for those pepole.</p>

                    <h3>Education for a child</h3>
                    <p>Education is a fundamental right of all children, but children in emergencies are constantly
                        denied this right - in 2015 humanitarian emergencies and protracted crises disrupted the
                        education of more than 80 million children.</p>
